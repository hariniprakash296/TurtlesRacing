# TurtlesRacing
The turtles racing project gets the number of turtles a user wants between 2 to 10. It then assigns each turtle a colour and positions the turtles at equal distances at the bottom of the screen and then races them!
After that the winning turtle that crosses the finish line first, is selected as the winner and displayed. This program has been run and shown below:
